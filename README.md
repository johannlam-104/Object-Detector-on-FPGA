# Red-Object-Detector-on-FPGA-Using-OV7670-Camera-and-HDMI-Output
In development, done on Nexys A7

The aim for this project is to detect a red object and overlay a green crosshair over ov7670 camera feed, and be displayed on a HDMI monitor using TMDS encoding

### Features:
-RGB444 thresholding
-3x3 convolution kernels
-centroid calculation
-HDMI (TMDS Encoding)
